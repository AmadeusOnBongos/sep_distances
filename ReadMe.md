This repository provides an implementation of separation distances and s/c-metrics
for causal graphs as introduced in the paper 'Separation-based distance metrics for causal graphs'.

The metrics are implemented in the metrics.py file and are employed the graph class defined in mixed_graph.py

I am sure that much can still be improved or sped up, so do not hesitate to contact me with suggestions or comments.
